            For the fourth time, my friends and I have stayed at the Dahlia
            family house. Now the facilities are even more complete. There is a
            barbeque place in the backyard. It's also great for gathering with
            family or friends. There is a fish pond that can be used for
            fishing, so if you grill the fish the fish is fresh and we can use
            complete cooking equipment. Basically, it's even more comfortable to
            stay at the Dahlia family house.
